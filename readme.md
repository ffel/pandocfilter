Pandoc Filters in Go
====================

Pandoc [filters](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/scripting.html) are a
convenient way to extend Pandoc.

I'll explore writing these filters with [Go](http://golang.org) here.

Development is done in the `dev` branch. Anything useable will be merged
in `master`.
